# NYC-Yellow-Cab-Pickup-Predictor
Predicts the best zipcode to find the best fare for NYC Yellow Cabs.

This is a "Side-Project" that was completed to show as a DEMO as a part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship application process in Spring 2018

Best is defined as:
- Locations with highest demand
- Within in the distance of a search radius

The TaxiData-DateInteraction.ipynb notebook contains the data analysis and machine learning model fitting to generate the predictive model
